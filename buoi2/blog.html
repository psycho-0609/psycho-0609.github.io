            I’ve taken three different blogs to over $1 million per year. In fact, the blog you’re reading right
            now has made a total of $5.3 million.

        <p>In a moment, I’m going to show you a general framework you can follow to start a profitable blog from
            scratch.
            <br><br>
            But first, let’s jump into the specifics of how to make money blogging, including real-world examples you
            can study and learn from.
            <br><br>
            Here are the top 7 ways to make money blogging:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Online Courses and Workshops</h3>
        <p>Here at Smart Blogger, we make most of our income from online courses and workshops — over $1 million per
            year — but we are far from the only ones.
            Most of the people making serious money from their blogs are doing it <a href="">through online courses</a>.
            <br>
            Ramit Sethi reportedly crossed $10 million dollars in annual revenue with his <a href="">suite of premium
                courses</a>:
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="https://smartblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ramit-sethi-premium-courses.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>And it’s not only business or wealth focused topics that are doing well. You can find blogs on just about any
            topic monetizing with online courses.
            For instance, the popular interior designer <a href="">Maria Killam</a> has quite a few courses and
            workshops in her catalog:</p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="https://smartblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maria-killam-courses-and-workshops.png"
                alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>2. Books and Ebooks</h3>
        <p>Quite a few writers have parlayed their blogging success into a major publishing deal. Mark Manson, for
            instance, published a post called <a href=""> The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck in 2015</a>.
            Millions of readers later, he got a book deal with Harper Collins and went on to sell over 3,000,000 copies
            in the US alone.</p>

                alt="">
        </div>

        </div>
        <h3>3. Affiliate Marketing </h3>
        <p>
            If you’d like to create some passive income streams from your blog, one of the best choices is affiliate
            marketing — recommending the services, digital products,
            and physical products of other companies in exchange for a commission.
            <br>
            Here at Smart Blogger, we make more than $100,000 per year promoting affiliate products, most of that coming
            from casually recommending products we love like
            Siteground (affiliate link) and Ahrefs (affiliate link).
            <br>
            But there are lots of other examples too. For instance, Digital Photography School has reportedly made over
            $500,000 in Amazon Associates commissions from
            promoting photography equipment:

        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="https://smartblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/digital-photography-school-amazon-affiliate.png"
                alt="">
        </div>
        <p>With so many companies offering <a href=""> referral programs</a> to help spread the word about their product
            or service, the number of different affiliate marketing opportunities is enormous.</p>
        <h3>4. Advertising</h3>
        <p>
            Normally, we’re not big fans of selling ads on your site. You need roughly a million visitors per year for
            the large ad networks to take you seriously, and affiliate marketing is almost always more
            profitable and just as passive.
            <br>
            <br>
            That being said, some niches like recipes, fashion, and news are hard to monetize through many of the other
            methods
            mentioned here, and they get LOTS of page views. In that case, putting a few ads on your site can make sense
            as a supplementary income source.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, here’s a screenshot of a <a href=""> 2016 income report</a> from Share the Yummy:
        </p>

            <img src="https://smartblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/share-the-yummy-income-report.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Normally, you make money by joining a network. Nearly anyone can join Google AdSense, for example, 
            and you can later grow into more selective networks like Mediavine and AdThrive.
