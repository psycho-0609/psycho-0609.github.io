    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p id="para-html">
        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a web browser.
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.
        <br>
        <span id="red">
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages.
        </span> 
        ibes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        <br>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may
        be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
        semantics for
        text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
        <i>tags</i>,
        written using angle brackets.Tags such as 1 <span>&lt;img/&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;input/&gt;</span> directly
        introduce content into the page.
        Other tags such as <span>&lt;p/&gt;;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as sub-elements.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        <br>
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages.
        CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
        and current
        maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p id="para-css">
        <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
        a document
        written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and JavaScript.
        <br>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in
        a separate. css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
        <br>
        <span id="green">
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
            for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
            Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
        </span> 
        <br>
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
        if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. <br>
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
        <span>text/css</span> is registered
        for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
        <br>
        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
    </p>
    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p class="para-js">
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a programming
        language that conforms
        to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
        has curly-bracket syntax,
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br>
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables
        interactive web
        pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page
        behavior,
        and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
        <br>
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application
        programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
        the Document Object
        Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage,
        or graphics
        facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs. <br>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually
        via Node.js.
        They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
        Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective
        standard
        libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
